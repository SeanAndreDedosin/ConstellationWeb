			<p>We are a small group of students who are currently studying on how to create websites. Our small objective is to help those who are in need for learning simple HTML and CSS Codes. We believe this will be both beneficial for ourselves and for others around us and only hope to build on a more friendly atmosphere when creating these. With the right tips and tricks, you will be able to design a basic website of your own.</p>

			<p>This Website covers the basics and is a good way to get introduced into making websites.

			As a quick brief on both Computing Languages - HTML and CSS both funtion differently but for good reason. A quick way of understanding both is that HTML is used to provide content to the Page whilst CSS is used to style and decorate the said content. 
				<br>
			In even simpler terms - HTML provides the texts and images and CSS is used to position or change size of texts or images.
				<br>
				<br>
			Test yourselves with our quiz if you think you are up for the challenge. 
				<br>
			Note - It is a lot easier than you think, don't fret over it.
